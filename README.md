In this Project I am working on the MNIST dataset using a convolutional neural network.

I downloaded the data from Kaggle.

I then import the dataset, scale it and create a model.

I then split the data into training and eval.

I then fit the model on the training dataset and evaluate the model.

I plot the training vs eval curves to see if the number of epochs is sufficient as well as the model being sufficient in learning the general lessons contained within the dataset.

I also plot the confusion matrix to see the performance of the model on each individual number.
